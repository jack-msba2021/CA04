Ensemble Methods

Project Overview
This project practices training and predicting with ensemble methods such as Random Forest, AdaBoost, Gradient Boost, and XGB models.


## Requirements
The following can be used to run the Python code for this project:

 - [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb#recent=true)

  
### Installation
The following packages are needed for this project:
```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier, AdaBoostClassifier, GradientBoostingClassifier
from sklearn import metrics
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
!pip install xgboost
from sklearn import datasets
import xgboost as xgb
```
